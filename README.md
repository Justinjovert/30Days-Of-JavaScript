# 30 Days of JavaScript

This challenge gave me a solid understanding on JavaScript. This challenge has taught me both basic and advanced topics of JavaScript.

I started this challenge back in December 2023, and finished on the last week of April 2024. I diligently work on each topics of the challenge, sometimes taking me days or week to understand and solve a mini-project. 

My focus on this challenge was to learn JavaScript. Design was the kept to the minimum and just barely match to how the challenge/mini-project was designed.


# Next Steps

Having completed the challenge, I set to develop my skills with projects and slowly build my portfolio. 
Once I am cofident with my skills, I plan to learn JavaScript frameworks and libraries to broaden my skill sets.
